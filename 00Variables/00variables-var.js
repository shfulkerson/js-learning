//Variables are a programming construct which allows the storing of data
//The data can be in multiple formats
  //In javascript, the datatype (ie number, letters, etc...) isn't determined until
  //the variable is assigned

//here we have declared and initilized two different variables of two different types
//we are using the keyword var (prior to ES6, this was the only way to declare a variable in JS)
    //var stands for variable
    //when you use the keyword var, the scope of the variable is global (we will learn more about this later)
var myName = 'Fulkerson';   //variables myName and favWord have been set up as "String" variables
var favWord = 'sequester';
var favNum = 5280;          //favNum is a variable with the type: number

//the following three lines of code print our variables to the console

console.log(myName);
console.log(favWord);
console.log(favNum);

/**
 * place your code here
 * Expectations: write a code snippet which creates four variables and prints them
 * to the console
